# Drum machine

This project is a solution to the FreeCodeCamp project 'Build a drum machine' (https://learn.freecodecamp.org/front-end-libraries/front-end-libraries-projects/build-a-drum-machine)
The app is live at https://ecstatic-jang-0f6cc0.netlify.com/

**Note:** The last test does not pass. I suspect this is because I am not actually displaying the string 'when the drum pad is triggered', but rather whenever a drum plays. I believe this is preferrable, and a better user experience.
